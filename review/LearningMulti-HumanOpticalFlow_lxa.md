## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 What has our methods done && How we do this

- An extension to Learning Human Optical Flow. the Human Optical Flow dataset can be divided into SHOF(Single Human Optical Flow, only one person in motion) and MHOF(Multi Human Optical Flow, contain multiple people involving significant occlusion between them)
- 【Question: what's the process of fine-tune?】
